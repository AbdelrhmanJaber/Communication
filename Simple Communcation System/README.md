In this project, you will implement a very simple communication systems as shown in the
following figure. Here you try to send a sound file over a communication channel & then try
to receiver it.

1. Transmitter
At the first stage, which is called the transmitter. You will enter your sound file and prepare
it for the transmission over the channel.
Requirement:
- Play your sound file through Matlab
- Plot your sound file in time domain and the frequency domain

2. Channel
The channel has the following impulse response. At this stage, you will need to pass your
sound message over the channel

3. Noise
The program should have the ability to add noise (simply random signal) to the
output of the channel

4. Receiver
You will construct an ideal low pass filter and reduce it from the signal
